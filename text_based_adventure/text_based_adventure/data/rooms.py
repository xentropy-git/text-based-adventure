You fumble for a moment before finding the small, stubborn flint and steel in your pack. With a few strikes, a spark ignites the wick of your lantern, casting a warm glow around you. The cave is damp and cold, the air heavy with the scent of earth and moss.
As you survey the cave, you knew you came prepared for whatever lies ahead. Your pack is heavy with essential items, each chosen carefully for this moment.  With your pack secure and your lantern casting its glow, you take a deep breath and step further into the unknown."""
